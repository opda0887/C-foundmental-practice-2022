# 🌀 製作目的(Purpose)

大學的第一學期終於結束了，我的初體驗是：新鮮、有趣。課程不再那麼死板，能活用的機會變多。在這其中，我所主修的 "程式設計(一)" 就有許多的新知識讓我去學習。想在這寒假期間，把我新學的 "C 語言" 再複習一次，讓自己維持熟練度。

The first semester of university is finally over, and my first experience is: fresh and interesting. The curriculum is no longer so rigid, and there are more opportunities to use it flexibly. Among them, the "Programming (1)" I majored in has many new knowledge for me to learn. I want to review my newly learned "C language" again during this winter vacation so that I can maintain my proficiency.
